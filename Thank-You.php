		<h4>Congratulations! You’ve done it! </h4>
		
		<p>You have a toolbox full of fabulous iPEC coaching skills and you’re on your way toward a thriving coaching practice.  But as you walk down this road of imagining what’s next, I invite you to really visualize making the transitioning to your full-time job  connecting your AND Factor – that "something more" that money can’t always buy: health, vitality, deeper personal relationships… What is it that would be the cherry on top for YOU?</p>
		<p>I’m exited to share my Lifestyle Lifeline 3-Step Process for Creating Your "Get out of Corporate, Get into Full-Time Coaching" Action Guide and brief training audio. The time you spend working on these materials can mean the difference between a frustrating transition that drags on and a seamless, fun transition that feels effortless. So that you maximize the benefits of this training, I recommend printing out the action guide and working through it as you listen to the audio.</p>

		<p>Step 1: Use this checklist to assess what you might need to do to get your AND Factor when it comes to your coaching career.</p>

		<p>Step 2: Create strategies to close the gaps and get what your AND Factor.</p>

		<p>Step 3: Develop your accountability strategy for staying on track (partner, program, etc.)</p>

		<p>To a smooth transition,<br>
		~Natasha</p>
