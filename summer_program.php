			  <p>I talk to dozens of successful, high-achieving professionals every month who struggle to find the proverbial work/life balance. They know there is something bigger outside of work, something bigger than the paycheck, something bigger that’s so soul-satisfying that makes life feel amazing regardless of what’s going on. I’ve been there myself &mdash; working too much and living too little. I know what it’s like to feel as if your value is just as good as the last great achievement you made at work, promising yourself that you’ll get your to-do list under control, hoping that this weekend will be different than the others, getting through yet another superficial conversation with someone who probably has already forgotten your name, believing (insert short-term feel-good strategy here) will make you feel more complete.</p>

		<h2>Here’s what we’ll cover:</h2>
		
			<h3>[Module #1] Goal setting 2.0 for today’s busy professional.</h3>
			<p><b>This is all about knowing yourself and what you want.</b> We’ll kick things off by creating a foundation for your summer. When was the last time you took time to think about what you really want and you really are. I’ll guide you through a process to help assess what’s most important to you. This proven process ensure that the most important ingredient of your summer (YOU!) is primed for success. You’ll walk away understanding:</p>
			
			<ul style="list-style-image:url('images/check15.png'); margin-left: 0; padding-left: 1.5em; list-style-position: outside;">
				<li>Who you really are and want to be</li>
				<li>What’s been undermining your attempts to being the best version of yourself, having more fun and living a more soul-satisfying life</li>
			</ul>
			
			<hr>
			
			<h3>[Module #2] Kick Ho-Hum to the Curb</h3> 
			<p><b>What I know from my own experience and working with my clients is that you can’t expect to have an amazing experience when your time, energy and space is tied up in the things you don’t want to do.</b> We’ll use my proven ANDvitation Process to create your Summer Fun Map to keep you focused on what you want to experience to make this summer your best ever - without having to be a bitch, jerk or blowing off work.</p> 
			
			<p>You’ll make room for fun by:</p>
			<ul style="list-style-image:url('images/check15.png'); margin-left: 0; padding-left: 1.5em; list-style-position: outside;">
				<li>Learning how to recover from any set back, whether it’s traveling a ton for work, missing a workout, blowing your diet, not getting festival tickets, sitting through a bad date, ...

				<li>Discovering how to get what you want without working so hard (this is totally possible and NOT as hard as you think!)
				<li>Creating a vision for your ideal summer
			</ul>
			
			<hr>
			
			<h3>[Module #3] Livin’ the Dream</h3>
			<p>It’s time to shift gears and start living on your terms! Now that you’ve created your vision for the ideal summer, we’ll focus on filling your beach bag with the tools and strategies to make living your best summer ever a reality without having to sacrifice your success at work. By the end of module #3, you’ll be equipped with the following to live the dream:</p>

			<p>Creating spontaneity is key to having more fun and upgrading your AND. In this final module, we’ll focus on showing you how to let go of your control freak nature and invite spontaneity into your life. Studies show that random acts of unplanned experiences add energy (think kid-like) and loads of FUN to a simple summer day or evening. By the end of this module, you’ll set yourself up for more fun by:</p>

<h2>Sound like exactly the guidance, support and accountability you’ve been missing to Work Less and Have More Fun this summer?<br>
<a class="button" href="#">How to make this summer your best summer ever?</a><br>
Without the right mindset, belief system and vision, You keep getting the same (OK) results. You’re stuck working too much and living too little.<br>
But with the right mindset, belief system and vision, your entire life is soul-satisfying.<br>
Because YOU are soul-satisfied.<br>
The right mindset, belief system and vision is everything.<br>

But many times we’ll see opportunities like this and think to ourselves ...<br>
“I’m going to be traveling or too busy this summer to make the tele-sessions” </h2>

<p>Since the tele-sessions are recorded, you’re free to use the program whenever you’d like. Download it and listen when you’re commuting to work, in-flight, at the gym or anywhere else that’s most convenient for you.</p>
<p>Still questioning the time commitment? Yes. This program does take time. But not as much time as trying to piecemeal a solution together. And definitely not as much time as trying to figure it out on your own. Those two strategies are actually expensive because they cost you the one resource you can’t get back: time. Think about how you’d feel once you’ve figured out what it takes to have a soul-satisfying summer. How are you caring for your health and your body? Who are the people in your life that matter to you as much as you matter to them? Now consider that you’re not living that ideal life right now. And consider for how long you haven’t been living that ideal life. For how many more months can you really afford to lose out on that quality of life?</p>

<p><b>Bottom line: Procrastination is an expensive habit. Are you willing to keep it up?</b></p>
<hr>
<h2>“It’s probably too expensive ...”</h2>

<p>What I know is that “expensive” is relative. Expensive compared to what other option? The option that you’re currently choosing? I can guarantee you it’s not the option that’ll create the summer of your life. You wouldn’t have read this far if that “solution” was actually working for you and setting you up for your best summer. I can also guarantee that you’ve bought an outfit, shoes, cologne, gadgets, cars, homes, furniture ... to find happiness and soul-satisfaction only to find temporary relief. A soul-satisfying summer is totally in reach for you. Are you willing to give yourself permission to have THAT soul-satisfying life this summer and beyond? Are you willing to do what it takes to feel like you deserve it? Or are you comfortable with your current work-life cycle? Your work-life cycle is directly tied to your AND which is tied to how soul-satisfied you feel. Want a more soul-satisfying life? Try putting some skin the game. It probably won’t require as much as skin as you think.
Bottom line: It only requires that you believe you’re worthy of your own investment.</p>

<h2>“I don’t have the time to participate”</h2>

<p>Not to worry! Each 75-minute tele-session will be recorded and made available to you within 24 hours so you can stay on track to working less and having more fun this summer.</p>

<p><b>Bottom line: This virtual summer camp is as flexible as you need it to be.</b></p>
<hr>		

<h2>“I should be able to do it on my own -- besides I probably won’t get enough attention to make a difference.”</h2>

<p>Think about how you got this far in life. I’m willing to bet you had mentors and other supporters showing you the way and that having extra support helped smooth out what could have otherwise been a bumpier ride. The reality is that to have this kind of soul-satisfying life you need support, guidance and accountability. Why should you have to go on your own to a place where you have no map? Why should you be able to build on your own a life for which you have no blueprint? (And if you had the current map and blueprint AND they were going to work, wouldn’t they have worked by now?)</p>
<p>In addition to the four teaching calls, there are two months of lifestyle support with the Ask the Expert Soul-Satisfied Forum which are dedicated to answering your specific questions. And I’ll be available by email between tele-sessions to keep you on track to working less and having more fun this summer.</p>
<p>It’s time for you to enjoy the lifestyle you always wanted -- the lifestyle of the confident, successful, high-achieving, soul-satisfied professional who can have a great career AND an amazing life. Work Less, Have More Fun virtual summer camp will make this lifestyle your reality this summer.</p>
<p>Allow me to get a little coach-y here.</p>

<p><b>Bottom line: If you’re stuck on what you “should” or “shouldn’t” be able to do, you’re shoulding all over yourself and this belief is a form of pride that will keep you stuck at living an “OK/Just Fine” kind of life</b></p>

<h3>What's at stake?</h3>
<p>Research repeatedly shows that people who don’t change their patterns end up working too much and living too little, constantly feeling that something is missing despite every effort to fill the void or “do better”. And, while I know it’s hard to hear, without formal support, education and coaching, the truth is this: most high-achieving professionals won’t make the changes necessary to have an amazing life above and beyond a successful career.</p>
<p><b>I know it’s hard to hear, but it’s the truth.</b></p>
<p>Let’s say you didn't get this program, where will that leave you? I can't make the decision for you. It's 100% up to you. I can help you, but you've got to take the first step.
